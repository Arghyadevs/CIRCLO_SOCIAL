## Step 1: Add Environment Variables to Vercel (5 min)

### Go to Vercel:
👉 **https://vercel.com/dashboard**

1. Click your project: **circlo-devs7**
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Click **"Environment Variables"** in left menu

### Add These 2 Variables:

#### Variable 1: API URL
```
Name:        VITE_API_URL
Value:       https://circlo-social.onrender.com/api
Environment: ✅ Production ✅ Preview ✅ Development
```
👆 Copy this exactly! ⚠️ No quotes, no trailing slash

#### Variable 2: Clerk Key
```
Name:        VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY  
Value:       [Get from Clerk Dashboard]
Environment: ✅ Production ✅ Preview ✅ Development
```

**How to get Clerk key:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Select your application
3. Go to: **API Keys**
4. Copy the **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_`)

VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=[Your Sender ID]
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=[Your App ID]
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=[Your Measurement ID]

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to: **Project Settings** → **General**

## 🚨 If Something's Wrong

- No trailing slash!

### "401 Unauthorized" errors?
**Fix:**
- Add `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` to Vercel
- Get it from: https://dashboard.clerk.com
- Redeploy Vercel

### Backend not responding?
**Fix:**
